# Phishnet

- Gmail app to scrape emails for assets linking to websites in alexa top 2000
- If assets link to accredited websites, and other assets link to spam sites, the email is a phishing attempt
- For less sophisticated phishing emails, students can flag them as potential phishing. Flags are sent to CIT, and sites can be added to a local phishing list so students can't access them. Can potentially be spread out if product is licensed to multiple universities, colleges, schools, businesses, etc.
